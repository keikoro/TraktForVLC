TraktForVLC [![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/XaF/TraktForVLC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/XaF/TraktForVLC) [![AppVeyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/e1ie51bwhbki60ns/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/XaF/traktforvlc/branch/master)
===========

TraktForVLC allows scrobbling VLC content to [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/).

TraktForVLC 2.x works by using together a lua VLC module and a Python helper script in order to find information on the media you are watching.
Contrary to previous versions of TraktForVLC, the VLC module allows for a direct binding in your media activity (play, pause, stop) and thus to take immediate actions on your [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/) account.

### External libraries and resources

The `vlc-logo-1s.mp4` file in this repository, also distributed in the binary files for Windows, contains a VLC logo that is not owned by this project. This logo is owned by its authors. VideoLAN can be reached on [their website](https://www.videolan.org/).

TraktForVLC uses external libraries and APIs for the media resolution:
* The [OpenSubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.org/) API
* [The TVDB](https://www.thetvdb.com/) API (through the [tvdb_api](https://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api) Python package); TV information is provided by TheTVDB.com, but we are not endorsed or certified by TheTVDB.com or its affiliates.
* The [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) API (through the [imdbpie](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/imdbpie) Python package)
* The [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API (through the [tmdbsimple](https://github.com/celiao/tmdbsimple) Python package); This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

TraktForVLC is not endorsed or certified by any of these external libraries and resources owners.


## Installation

### Finding the installers

Installers are provided in the [GitHub release section](https://github.com/XaF/TraktForVLC/releases).
The [latest release is available here](https://github.com/XaF/TraktForVLC/releases/tag/latest); however, we highly recommend using a stable release if you are not sure of what you are doing.

Once you have found the installer that corresponds to your operating system and downloaded it, simply running it will allow you to install TraktForVLC with the default parameters.

### Installation per OS

On Windows, you can right-click and run the file with the administrator privileges to start the install process. The administrator privileges are required as, on Windows, the Python helper is installed as a Windows service.

On Linux and MacOS, make the file executable (using `chmod +x file`) and then run it in the command line (`./TraktForVLC_version_os`).

### Initial configuration

At the end of the first installation, the initial configuration will automatically be started by the installer.
This process aims at authorizing TraktForVLC to access your [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/) account.

Depending on your OS, the process is presented a bit differently:
* On Linux and MacOS: a message giving instructions will appear directly at the end of the installation logs
* On Windows: a VLC window will be started and the screen will soon show a message giving instructions

The message shown should look like the following:
```
TraktForVLC is not setup with Trakt.tv yet!
--
PLEASE GO TO https://trakt.tv/activate
AND ENTER THE FOLLOWING CODE:
9EC4F248
```

The instructions are to go to a URL and enter a given code. Please do while keeping the process (VLC window on Windows) active, and wait after entering the code and validating the authorization that the process stops by itself.
If you stops the process before then, you will need to restart the initial configuration manually.

To restart the initial configuration process manually, the following command might be used: `./TraktForVLC_version_os init_trakt_auth`

## Configuration file

The configuration file for TraktForVLC is a JSON file named `trakt_config.json`.

### Location
The `trakt_config.json` file is located in your VLC configuration directory. Depending on your OS, the VLC configuration directory will be located at the following places:
* Linux: `~/.config/vlc`
* MacOS: `~/Library/Preferences/org.videolan.vlc`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%/vlc` (where `%APPDATA%` is the value of the `APPDATA` environment variable)

## Issues
Please use the [GitHub integrated issue tracker](https://github.com/XaF/TraktForVLC/issues) for every problem you can encounter. Please **DO NOT** use my email for issues or walkthrough.

When submitting an issue, please submit a VLC logfile showing the error. You can start VLC in debug mode (`-vv` option) to obtain more thorough logs.

On MacOS, VLC is run from the command line in verbose mode like so:
```
$ /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC -vv
```

> **Please** be careful to remove any personnal information that might still be in the logfile (password, identification token, ...) before putting your file online.
